# Pandemic-themed <i>Where's Waldo?</i> ðŸ˜·ðŸ¦ 

A fun and interactive game inspired by the popular book, <i><Where's Waldo?/i>, aimed to help children and youth understand the importance of protecting themselves against the COVID-19 "monster". 

Somewhere amid a crowded scene is the COVID-19 monster, which the user has to locate. Once the user clicks on the monster, it disappears, and the user gains points. Once all the monsters are gone, the game ends. The user is then directed to the main page where educational websites about COVID-19 are provided.
